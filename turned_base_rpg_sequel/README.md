  - Generates random stats for all characters (character count chosen by player)
  - Player choose 1 character
  - Fight other characters
  - Player & opponent can choose 1 of 4 moves: attack, crit (50% chance fail), block, heal
  - Attack damage is blocked by defense (1:1)
  - Crit damage is 1.5x of normal
  - Much less luck-based, balance is bad (randomized stats)
